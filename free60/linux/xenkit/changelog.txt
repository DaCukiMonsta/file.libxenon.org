xenKit project (hardware accelerated graphics for 360)

Currently: Thinking about another version of xenKit (fully based on tmbinc's gpu demo)
- 1080i support (get rid of current 1024 pixels width limit, due to hardcoded values)
- Real way to avoid screen flickering
- New KK Patch to start homebrew another way (minidash for 360, probably)
(Absolutely no ETA on these ones... Will take time...)

20090328 home.tele2.fr/~fr-51785 (will stop working) replaced with minilgos.perso.sfr.fr
20071016 xenkit_x11_lighting.zip released! Adds gouraud lighting shaders! (1 source)
20071001 xenkit_x11.zip released! Adds mouse and keyboard support in windowed mode!
20070929 After some adjustment here comes xenkit_core.zip! Merge of tmbinc's sources!
20070928 tmbinc published final version of his gpu demo! (his blog : http//x226.org)

Thanks to tmbinc and Tser for their wonderful work on 360!

Note: Original demo tmbinc's gpu-0.0.3 + romextract-0.0.1 will crash under Gentoo.
You will need xenkit_core.zip, which is 100% compatible with Gentoo Live CD Beta 2.
(login as root, transfert files, type in "make", type in "./gpu"! See readmetoo.txt)

Couldn't find a way to detect new position of window when you move it. So resolve
will be static. Also couldn't find a way to add offsets to the resolve, so, can't
really have centered rendering inside window. Can be fixed, surely, with study...
